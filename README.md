# Hair-Simulation
The hair simulation application is a 3D modeling (Rhino) application developed in python, which is able to simulate hair generation. 3D hairs can generate on any surfaces with controls in density, length, and environmental interference.

Hairs are generated on the surfaces based on their UV coordinates, and mild vibration was introduced into the algorithm to simulate the variety of hair typology. The 3D hairs generate on a highly adaptive system that can modify its direction and length according to this host surfaceâ€™s typology. If a liner attractor is introduced, the hair will grow based on its position, thus create various hairstyles.
